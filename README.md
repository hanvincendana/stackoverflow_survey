There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python 3 versions.
If you don't have a library installed, just use `!pip install` to install the necessary libraries.

# Project Motivation
The purpose of this project was to understand
1. Which company types pay the best salaries to developers
2. How programming experience impacts wages across the various types of companies
3. How the type of working model (remote / hybrid / office-based) impacts salary and job satisfaction of the developers

# File Description
The notebook here has all of the workings used to answer the 3 questions above.

# Results
The key findings of the code can be found at the post available [HERE](https://medium.com/@mochen862/how-does-developer-pay-vary-by-company-type-experience-and-working-model-46649357b78d).
